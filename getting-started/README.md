# Getting started

Welcome to the __Mews Open API__. This is a powerful tool that enables you to easily connect your hospitality software into Mews and become part of our ecosystem of integrated solutions.
Use the __Mews Open API__ to fetch data, make bookings, adjust rates, post charges, upsell products, and do a myriad of other things.

We take the 'open' part very seriously, which is why we make it as easy as possible to connect and why we are always trying to remove barriers to successful adoption.
We provide a Demo environment for developers so you can start coding and testing straight away.
All the documentation is compact and straightforward and publicly hosted on [GitHub](https://github.com/MewsSystems).

## A family of APIs

The __Mews Open API__ is in fact a family of three APIs. Each API operates independently, serving a different function, and each has its own documentation.

* See [The Mews APIs](../the-mews-apis/README.md)

## What do you want to achieve?

Take a look at [The Mews APIs](../the-mews-apis/README.md) to see which is the API for you.
The documentation for each API includes examples of common use cases for that API, or you can find an overview of all of them in [Use Cases](../use-cases/README.md).

## Getting stuck in

Each API includes a Guidelines section explaining how to use the API, including quick-start information for connecting to a Demo environment and getting results right away.

## Help with terminology

Throughout your Mews journey, you may find terms that are unfamiliar or unclear. That's why we created the [Mews Glossary for Open API users](https://help.mews.com/s/article/Mews-Glossary-for-Open-API-users?language=en_US).
The Glossary provides a full description of all the terms used across the individual Mews APIs.
