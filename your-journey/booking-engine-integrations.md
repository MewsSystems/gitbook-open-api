# Booking Engine integrations

The integration process for the Booking Engine API is streamlined compared to other Mews APIs and does **not** require certification or a pilot property. Follow these steps:

* [Step 1: Explore the API](#step-1-exploration)
* [Step 2: Register your client name](#step-2-registration)
* [Step 3: Develop and test your integration](#step-3-development)
* [Step 4: Go live in Production](#step-4-go-live)

If you have questions about the process, contact us at [partnersuccess@mews.com](mailto:partnersuccess@mews.com).

> **Client name**: Unlike other Mews APIs, the Booking Engine API uses a `client name` instead of a `Client Token` for authentication.

## Step 1: Exploration

Explore the [Booking Engine Guide](https://mews-systems.gitbook.io/booking-engine-guide/) and familiarize yourself with the API guidelines and operations. Not sure if the API is the right option? See [Booking Engine Guide ways to integrate](https://mews-systems.gitbook.io/booking-engine-guide/faq/ways-to-integrate).

> **Availability note**: Access to the Booking Engine API is only available to Mews customers on Enterprise packages.

## Step 2: Registration

Before you can use the API in a live environment, you need to register your `client name` and other details with Mews, including a contact email for your development department. The email address will be used to notify you about important changes in the API.

### Recommended: Use the Mews Digital Assistant

You can register directly from within the Mews platform using the **Mews Digital Assistant** (available to logged-in users). Follow the chatbot flow to open a ticket and use the following template:

> _Subject: **Booking Engine API client name registration**_
>
> * _**Client name:** `<insert your client name>`_
> * _**Contact email:** `<insert your contact email>`_
> * _**Environments:** `<Demo and/or Production>`_

### Alternatively: Register by email

If you do not have access to the Mews Digital Assistant, you can email [support@mews.com](mailto:support@mews.com) using the following template:

> _Subject: **Booking Engine API client name registration**_
>
> _Dear Mews support,_
> 
> _We would like to register the following client for Booking Engine access:_
>
> * _**Client name:** `<insert your client name>`_
> * _**Contact email:** `<insert your contact email>`_
> * _**Environments:** `<Demo and/or Production>`_
>
> _Best regards,_
>
> _`<Your team/company name>`_

While your `client name` is being registered, you can begin testing using the [sample client name](https://mews-systems.gitbook.io/booking-engine-guide/booking-engine-api/guidelines/authorization) provided in the documentation.

## Step 3: Development

Use the Demo environment to start building and testing your integration. Until your own `client name` is registered, you can use the sample `client name`. All of the information you need to start developing and testing is in the [Booking Engine Guide](https://mews-systems.gitbook.io/booking-engine-guide/).

## Step 4: Go live

Once your integration is tested and ready, you can switch to the Production environment. Booking Engine integrations do not need to be certified or piloted. You are good to go once your `client name` is active in the Production environment.

> **Environment registration**:
> Mews maintains separate `client name` lists for Demo and Production environments. Ensure you are explicitly registered for each environment you plan to use.
