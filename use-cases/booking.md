# Booking

If you are implementing a Booking Engine and want to allow your customers to make bookings directly in Mews, you will want the [Mews Booking Engine API](https://mews-systems.gitbook.io/booking-engine-guide/).
This is one of three solutions we offer for Booking Engine integration, from off-the-shelf to custom, depending on the resources you have available.
All of this is described in the [Mews Booking Engine Guide](https://mews-systems.gitbook.io/booking-engine-guide/), of which the API is a part.
